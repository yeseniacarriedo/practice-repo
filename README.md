## Instructions: 

- Update the `flpoly_student.md` file with your information. Make sure to practice by typesetting this Markdown file using any of the options introduced in class as you seem appropriate (e.g., using **bold** or _italicized_ fonts, including figures and hyperlinks, or creating tables).

- As usual, remember to add -> commit -> push to your copy of the repo on GitHub

_This is an introductory exercise to practice your Markdown and git skills. Make sure to contact your instructor if there are any questions!_
